# Kaggle Competition - Predicting Housing Prices

This project was done for the University of Zurich Course "Machine Learning for Economic Analysis" by Prof. Damian Kozbur. It was done by a group of 4 Students: Samir Sulejmani, Felix Jost (me), Marc Zeugin, and Simon Cappelli.

Our study group decided to partake in a Kaggle Housing Price Prediction Competiton [https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques].

The Project looks into Data Cleaning and Prediction Techniques such as:

1) Data Cleaning
    1) Turning features into normally distributed features
    2) Dealing with outliers (Running the Predictions w/ and w/o Outliers to check for Robustness)
    3) Dealing with Missing Values
2) Prediction Techniques
    1) OLS Regression
    2) Ridge Regression
    3) Lasso Regression
    4) Random Forests
    5) Gradient Boosting
    6) Neural Networks
    7) Hybrid Regression Model (Weighted Average of other Prediction Techniques) 

### Table of Contents:

1) Report.pdf
2) Notebook_with_out_outliers.ipynb
3) Notebook_with_outliers.ipynb

The Report.pdf contains our write up for the project, and is the easiest way to understand what we did. The two notebooks show the afformentioned techniques and predictions in Jupyter Notebooks.
